AI-Enhanced Secured Watermarking and Labelling is a Python-based system developed to protect digital content by embedding secure watermarks and generating intelligent, content-aware labels. The project combines computer vision and AI by integrating technologies like OpenCV, NumPy, and OpenAI’s CLIP model. It analyzes both images and text files to understand their semantic content, and then embeds watermarks accordingly to ensure authenticity, traceability, and copyright protection. The system supports batch processing and simulates distributed workflows, making it scalable and adaptable for real-world applications such as digital rights management, content classification, and tamper detection. Designed with modularity and automation in mind, this project highlights the practical fusion of artificial intelligence with content security.
